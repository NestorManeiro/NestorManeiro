### 🧑‍💻 About Me

🎯 I currently work as a **Software Engineer at Xelios Biometrics**, developing biometric solutions in **.NET**, building **REST APIs**, and handling **DevOps** and **systems integration** tasks.

💻 My main focus is backend development. I hold a degree in **Computer Engineering**.

🚀 I love solving problems and learning new technologies. Recently, I’ve been working with **OpenCV** and **Tesseract**. While my core stack is in **.NET**, I also enjoy building tools and automations in **Python**.

🤖 I'm highly interested in **Artificial Intelligence**, especially in areas like **AI-generated content detection and generation**.

🌴 Originally from the **Canary Islands**, I'm always open to new projects and collaborations.
