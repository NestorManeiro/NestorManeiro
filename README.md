## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

ðŸŽ¯ I am currently working as a **Software Engineer at Xelios Biometrics**, developing biometric solutions in .NET, REST APIs, and handling complementary DevOps and systems integration tasks.

ðŸ’» My main focus is backend development. I hold a degree in Computer Engineering.

ðŸš€ I enjoy tackling new challenges and learning new technologies. Lately, Iâ€™ve been working a lot with OpenCV and Tesseract. Although I mostly work with .NET, I also like to build things with Python.

ðŸ¤– I am very interested in Artificial Intelligence, both in detecting AI-generated content and creating it myself.

ðŸŒ´ Iâ€™m from the Canary Islands and open to new projects and collaborations.
